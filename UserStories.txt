Then I should receive the following data:

GIVEN the users has entered some text
WHEN they the table appears
THEN the user should see table headings, characters, frequency, and relative frequency
AND see the characters printed below the character heading 
AND see the frequency printed below the frequency heading
AND see the relative frequency printed below the relative frequency heading
